Group Project: <Code for All_> #100 Bootcamp @ Porto
Timeline: 10 Days

//The Idea
•We decided to develop a turn-based RPG, one of our favorite game genres, for our first group project at the bootcamp.

//Development Process
•Initial Planning:Established the project skeleton and discussed interactions between classes.
Identified essential features versus improvements to focus on core game mechanics first.
•Task Assignment: Each programmer was assigned specific implementations, allowing independent work on different game aspects.
•Collaboration: Transitioned to a collaborative approach as individual components were completed, ensuring smooth integration and cohesive gameplay.

//Key Features
•Turn-Based Combat System: Players take turns to attack, use skills, or defend, emphasising strategy over reflexes.
•Character Classes: Diverse classes with unique abilities.

//Tech & Methodologies
•Languages & Paradigms: Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
•Libraries & Tools: Procedural SimpleGFX Library, IntelliJ IDEA
•Version Control: Git
